# Kanban Board

A responsive task management board

### Features
- Add Tasks
- Update Tasks
- Drag and Drop tasks
- Delete Tasks

> Structured the code into render/storage/dragdrop modules to divide the code into smaller, managable code files and to seperate the concerns.

> New Feature to add: Metrics on how much time user is taking to complete a task from "To-Do" to "Done" by adding a time stamp element to the task object (already being added to task id). Will show the metrics by implementing a Gantt Chart.
